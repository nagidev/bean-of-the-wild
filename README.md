# Clone of Zelda
As portrayed in [my youtube video](https://youtu.be/vYWoCeNTeA4), this is a godot game project showcasing my attempt at recreating the rune abilities from the famous Zelda game- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild. The game also consists of a custom shrine built using some ideas from the original game. The code is in no way optimized and is not intended for use in production. Please reuse elements from this project at your own discretion.

## Note
In case of any legal issues, I will be happy to put the repository offline without any questions asked.
